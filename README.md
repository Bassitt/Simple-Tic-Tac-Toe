# Simple-Tic-Tac-Toe
This is a simple tic-tac-toe interactive game with the ability for a user to make a move. To do this, we divide the grid into cells. Suppose the top left cell has the coordinates (1, 1) and the bottom right cell has the coordinates (3, 3):

(1, 1) (1, 2) (1, 3)
(2, 1) (2, 2) (2, 3)
(3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 3)

The program should ask the user to enter the coordinates of the cell where they want to make a move.

The user plays as X and O. Keep in mind that the first coordinate goes from top to bottom and the second coordinate goes from left to right. The coordinates can include the numbers 1, 2, or 3.
